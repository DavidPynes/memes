08.13.2024 - Sold the old car for 4k and then made 5k more in the markets. That's 32k this month. So, I went mountain biking.

08.14.2024 - early surf session before a busy day. 3 - 5 foot waves. finally a decent swell. not very good at surfing, but it sure is fun. I got entangled in some seaweed but slipped out before the set came.

================

Made friends with a nice lady at the DMV.  She had a weave in her hair and was eating watermelon.  She told me I was a good guy, and color-blind. 

What is so weird is that when I took my eye exam...I passed

Even the red light, green light, and yellow light tests. 

I was confused and asked the person at the counter, “so I’m not actually color blind?”

The officer said, “No sir, your vision is just fine.”

I don’t get it.
